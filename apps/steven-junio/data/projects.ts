      "I built this Devvit app for the Hack Reddit 2025 hackathon. I designed and implemented a system that allows users to submit thought-provoking questions, collect community responses, and visualize the 'battle of thoughts' as they gain or lose popularity. The app integrates Redis for user state management, a backend API for data storage, and Google Gemini API for categorizing and aggregating similar thoughts. Despite limitations with Devvit's native blocks, I created an interactive visualization that dynamically displays thoughts based on their popularity.",
